This is an AI twitter bot trained to read and reply to anime-related tweets.

Currently, the AI doesn't have a very high success rate due to a lack of usable data.
I'd say that the AI has a 70% success rate.

Some of the odd responses could be due to the AI not fully understanding the tweet or due to the nature of twitter being contradictory on opinons.
